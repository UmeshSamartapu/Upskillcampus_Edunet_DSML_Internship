Traffic Volume Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict traffic volume at various city junctions based on date-time and location features.
We preprocess the data, analyze feature importance, train an XGBoost regression model, and generate predictions for unseen test data.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

Pandas (data processing)

NumPy (numerical operations)

Matplotlib (data visualization)

Scikit-Learn (feature engineering, evaluation)

XGBoost (regression model)

Joblib (model saving)

Test.csv: Testing dataset

traffic_forecasting_model.pkl: Saved machine learning model

submission.csv: Final output predictions for the test data

🚀 How It Works
Data Preprocessing

Read the training and testing datasets.

Convert DateTime fields to datetime objects.

Extract features like Hour, DayOfWeek, Month, and Weekend indicator.

Feature Importance

Train an ExtraTreesClassifier to identify key features affecting vehicle traffic.

Visualize feature importances using bar plots.

Model Training

Use selected features to train an XGBoost Regressor.

Perform a train-validation split to internally validate the model.

Model Evaluation

Calculate Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the validation set.

Saving the Model

Save the trained model to a .pkl file for future use.

Test Predictions

Predict traffic volume on the test set.

Save the results in a submission file (submission.csv).

Visualization

Plot traffic volume trends across different junctions for combined training and predicted test data.

🧠 Key Features Extracted
Feature	Description
Junction	Junction ID where data is collected
Hour	Hour of the day
DayOfWeek	Day of the week (0=Monday, 6=Sunday)
IsWeekend	Whether the day is a weekend or not
Month	Month number (1-12)
📋 Requirements
Make sure you have these Python libraries installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost joblib
📈 Results
Achieved a reasonably low Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the validation dataset.

Captured traffic patterns influenced by time, weekday/weekend, and junction location.

Created smooth and interpretable traffic forecasts.

Encoding Handling: Files are read with 'ISO-8859-1' encoding to avoid Unicode issues.

Model Generalization: Future improvements could include hyperparameter tuning or trying advanced time-series models like LSTM.
